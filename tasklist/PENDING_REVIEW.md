HAND-MAINTAINED. Never regenerated. See "Pending release lists" in CLAUDE.md.

Changes a Claude session just finished, staged here so the user can try them once before they move
to PENDING_RELEASE.md for the final pre-release check. Two lines per change with a blank line between
them, grouped by task group in the fixed order fixes, workflow, gui-ux, major:

    - <slug> - <one-liner>

      Review:

Leave one blank line between a change's own one-liner and its Review: line as above, and two blank
lines between one change's Review: line and the next change's one-liner, so entries stay easy to
tell apart when skimming the file.

Fill in the Review: line yourself once you have tried the change, right here in the file, no chat
needed: a bare approval word and nothing else (approved / ok / okay / yes / lgtm) means it works, no
follow-up needed. Anything else, including an approval word plus more text ("approved, but X" does
NOT count), is read as a follow-up change to make in full, your own words, no particular format
required. The next /tasklist run resolves it: an approval moves the entry to PENDING_RELEASE.md, a
follow-up becomes a new task under tasklist/open/ (this line's text is its Title) and this entry is
dropped.
